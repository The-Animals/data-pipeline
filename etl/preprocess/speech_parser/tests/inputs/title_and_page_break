Health Budget 2020-2021 

Member Loyola: Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a serious concern 
brought  forward  by  constituents.  They’re  concerned  about  this 
budget,  a  budget  that’s  being  forced  through  this  Legislature  in 
record  time,  a  budget  that  isn’t  needed  when  interim  supply  and 
special warrants are available to the government, and a budget that 
obviously charts the wrong path for our province. My constituents 
are  concerned  about  real  cuts  to  health  care  as  proposed  in  this

budget. At a time when Alberta and the whole world are facing a 
virulent pandemic, it is unconscionable to my constituents that this 
government would make real cuts to the health care budget. 
My  constituents  are  also  concerned  that  this  budget  doesn’t 
provide the necessary support for our front-line health care workers, 
who  are  risking  their  own  health  to  protect  their  fellow  citizens. 
They  find  it  odd,  perplexing,  and  downright  confusing  that  the 
Health minister decided to tear up contracts with doctors, and they 
find  it  bewildering  that  he  announced  additional  changes  to 
radiologists yesterday.

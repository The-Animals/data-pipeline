Mr. Bilous:  Mr.  Speaker,  Alberta’s  film  industry  is  speaking  out 
against  this  UCP  government’s  budget.  Local  producers  are 
warning that cuts to the screen-based production grants will force 
productions to leave our province. Last  week HGTV productions 
Ms. Notley announced  that  they  will  be  moving  to  British  Columbia,  after 
operating in Alberta for over 37 years, because this UCP govern-
ment  misled  Albertans  about  diversifying  the  economy.  Can  the 
minister  of  economic  development  and  trade  clarify  why  she’s 
turning  her  back  on  the  film  industry  just  to  pursue  a  no-jobs 
corporate handout?

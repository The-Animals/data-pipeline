Member Ceci: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. You know, 
when I was listening to – a number of the references in the readings 
you were making I have not read myself, but I appreciate hearing 
them in this Chamber because I  think they are directly related to 
what  we  are  talking  about  in  terms  of  decision-making  and 
following orders and those sorts of things.

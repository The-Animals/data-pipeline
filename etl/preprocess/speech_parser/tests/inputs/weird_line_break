Ms Sweet:  Well,  thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  I  appreciate  the 
Government  House  Leader’s  response  to  our  amendment,  and  I 
appreciate that he has commented on the sessional calendar – that’s 
fine – and on the feeling of some of the briefings and lack thereof. 
  What I didn’t hear from the hon. Government House Leader is 
the openness and transparency around Public Accounts and why the 
government wouldn’t want to have any financial special warrants 
or  anything  that  this  government  may  have  to  do  through  the 

pandemic, why he wouldn’t want to be reporting to Public Accounts 
and  being  open  and  transparent  with  Albertans  around  any 
expenditures that maybe occurred outside of the budget that may or 
may not pass today.

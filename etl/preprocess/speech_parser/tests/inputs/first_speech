The Deputy Speaker:  Good  afternoon,  hon.  members.  Please  be 
seated. 

head:

The Deputy Speaker: Hon. members, it is a privilege to welcome 
back some familiar faces to this Chamber, members of the Alberta 
Association  of  Former  MLAs.  Please  rise  as  I  call  your  name:

head:

  Now, hon. members, as you may know, the Speaker hosted the

rotunda today, and I am so pleased to welcome two recipients of the

Congratulations. I’d also like to welcome the chair of the council,

Thank you for coming.

Ministerial Statements 

The Deputy Speaker:  The  Associate  Minister  of  Mental  Health 
and Addictions. 

 

Mental Health and Suicide Prevention 

Mr. Luan: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today I rise to speak in 
light of the tragic event that occurred yesterday on the steps of the 
Legislature.  Suicide  is  a  reality  that  far  too  many  Albertans  and 
Canadians  are  familiar  with.  Let’s  be  honest  with  each  other. 
Suicide is not an easy thing to talk about. It’s a heartbreaking reality 
that we must confront all together, and yesterday’s event has once 
again brought the tragedy of suicide into the spotlight. 
  Every day in Alberta one or more people may die of suicide and 
more may attempt suicide, not to mention the countless others who 
experience  depression  and  other  forms  of  mental  illness  that  can 
lead to suicide. The difficult reality is that each life lost to suicide 
leaves  a  ripple  effect  across  the  lives  of  those  who  live  on  –  the 
family, the friends, the loved ones – who are left with broken pieces 
of their lives, unable to make sense of this tremendous loss. It’s a 
loss  that  too  many  people  know.  I  want  to  remind  everyone 

experiencing those challenges that there are services available 24/7 
and that you are not alone. You are loved, you are valuable, you are 
strong, and you are worth it. 

The Deputy Speaker: The hon. Member for Edmonton-Manning.

Thank you, Madam Speaker. As all Albertans, we want to take care of each other, to be a shoulder to lean on at times when things are tough. Yesterday we lost a friend, a family member, an Albertan to suicide. Even though we may not know his name, we know of the common struggles he faced – the feeling of isolation, unloved, unwanted, struggling with perceived failures – moments that all of us can relate to. We all have days where we just don’t feel like we belong in the world that we live in. As the day-to-day stressors build up, some of us don’t know what to do, who to talk to, or even if we should. Many have been raised not to talk about their feelings, to man up, go to work, and just do what needs to be done. We know better. We know that as people we need to be heard, to feel valued, to know that even in moments of being vulnerable, it is okay, and the days will get better. We must take real steps to address the mental health crisis in the province. By working together, across all party lines, we can continue to build on the resources and supports that people need. We must continue to expand supports for children and youth so that we can address their mental health needs as early as possible and continue to recognize that as our world continues to become more complex, adults also can get the resources that they need. We all know in this House that there is much more to do. For those that are in need of support today, please reach out. If you feel that you can’t speak to a friend or a family member, then call the mental health line at 1.877.303.2642. It’s there 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We have a responsibility to each other in this House and in the province to take the time to listen, to talk to one another, to recognize that at different moments and at times we all need to be loved. So take that time. Slow down the business of the day and take a minute, a minute to take care of yourself, to breathe, and to enjoy the minutes and the moments that can quickly pass us by. Value who you are, the gift that you give to others around you in just being you. Value those around you, the ones that bring meaning to your life. Tell them that you love them, that they are important. Take the risk of being vulnerable, and show your true feelings to those who are around you. Take the time, that small moment of compassion, that moment of telling someone you love them. A quick hug can make all the difference to a person who just needs that moment. All we really have in the world is time: time to love, time to be loved, and time to enjoy the gifts that each day gives us. So tell the people around you that you love them. For those who are listening, for those who feel alone, you are valued, you are special, you are loved, and you deserve to live. Thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I think I would like to start by acknowledging that we are in unprecedented times, and we in the Official Opposition absolutely do support the recommendations of the chief medical officer of health, especially as it relates to a number of issues that she’s brought up. We do support and understand the government’s need to move quickly and potentially move differently in these circumstances. All that being acknowledged, I do not think that what is outlined in Government Motion 10 is in any way necessary.  Now, again, I acknowledge that we’re in unprecedented times, and I’d be more than happy to work on unprecedented measures like bringing in an interim supply and moving it very quickly if, for some reason, cabinet didn’t feel it had the authority to operate on special warrants, which in my view it does. Instead, we have this. Mr. Speaker, I don’t want to assume the reason underlying it, but the effect is that when this pandemic ends and we return to business hopefully as usual as possible, the public loses that opportunity to have scrutiny and to have oversight of the budget, which – again, one of the single most important things that a government does is allocate the money, the money that belongs, as members of the opposition are no doubt as familiar as I am, to all of us, not just those of us here in the Chamber, not just those of us in the government but every single citizen in this province. So I think that watching this is an incredible concern for me.

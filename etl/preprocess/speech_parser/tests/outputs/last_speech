Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I’m proud to rise after that particular speech. We have the Member for Edmonton-South West going on at great length about the deficit, which, incidentally, is $2 billion higher this year under the UCP than it was under the NDP last year. I think it’s also worth noting that the Member for Edmonton-South West went on at length about the raising of taxes, which I consider very interesting in light of the fact that he is basically chief minister in charge of the raising of taxes. This bill alone, in fact, significantly cuts funding to municipalities, specifically police funding to municipalities, forcing them to raise taxes or cut police. I think that municipalities are quite rational individuals, and they know that this is not a good time to be cutting back on police, so that foists the costs onto the residents of those municipalities. In addition, Mr. Chair, this minister has significantly cut MSI flowing to municipalities, again raising taxes on those municipal residents. The proposal in this bill, which was circulated to municipalities, rural municipalities specifically to make them pay up to 70 per cent of their police costs, could cost each individual resident up to $400 a year on their property taxes. So I think it’s a bit rich for the Member for Edmonton-South West to rise in this place and talk about how his values are not to raise taxes when, in fact, he has raised taxes on every Albertan in this province. The fact that he has used a shell game to force it onto municipalities doesn’t change that fact. This is a bill that raises taxes. And that’s fine. It’s within the government’s purview to do that, but at the end of the day it’s, I think, an unfair allegation to suggest that he’s against raising taxes when, in fact, he has done so on various fronts at various times. Now, certainly, there are a number of other issues in this bill, which I will be happy to address. I think that what I had hoped to address in this particular instance was changes to education, to advanced education specifically, but I see that we have reached 6 o’clock, so I will save my comments for our return.

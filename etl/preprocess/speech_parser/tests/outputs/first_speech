Thank you, Madam Speaker. Today I rise to speak in light of the tragic event that occurred yesterday on the steps of the Legislature. Suicide is a reality that far too many Albertans and Canadians are familiar with. Let’s be honest with each other. Suicide is not an easy thing to talk about. It’s a heartbreaking reality that we must confront all together, and yesterday’s event has once again brought the tragedy of suicide into the spotlight. Every day in Alberta one or more people may die of suicide and more may attempt suicide, not to mention the countless others who experience depression and other forms of mental illness that can lead to suicide. The difficult reality is that each life lost to suicide leaves a ripple effect across the lives of those who live on – the family, the friends, the loved ones – who are left with broken pieces of their lives, unable to make sense of this tremendous loss. It’s a loss that too many people know. I want to remind everyone experiencing those challenges that there are services available 24/7 and that you are not alone. You are loved, you are valuable, you are strong, and you are worth it.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you to the minister. Given that we are facing an unprecedented health crisis in this province and given that Albertans are being advised to practise social distancing and given that infrastructure projects not only require a large number of workers but also require people working together in close proximity and given that infrastructure projects are vitally important to the Alberta economy, to the same Minister of Infrastructure: what measures are being put in place to protect the safety of workers working on major and essential infrastructure projects?
Thank you again to the minister. Given that many projects are scheduled to begin in the upcoming construction season and given that institutions, like hospitals, where these projects are scheduled to take place are experiencing new challenges and given that one of these infrastructure project upgrades is taking place at the Medicine Hat regional hospital in Brooks-Medicine Hat and given that health and economic conditions change daily, to the same minister: at this time are infrastructure projects going forward for the upcoming construction season?
Mr. Speaker, we are absolutely making sure that our contractors have protocols in place to protect the health of their employees during the epidemic. We are in touch daily with the government property managers to ensure proper maintenance and cleaning of buildings managed by Alberta Infrastructure and also changing those protocols where required. In government buildings we are ensuring that hand sanitizers and soap are available adequately along with signage on proper handwashing and social distancing.
Mr. Speaker, my ministry officials are doing everything to ensure construction continues as planned. We are also identifying areas where processes can be expedited so we can get the shovels in the ground and Albertans back to work. I’m confident that Albertans will emerge from the uncertainty caused by this global pandemic, and our province’s best days still lie ahead. On that optimistic note, I would like to congratulate the hon. member on her engagement.

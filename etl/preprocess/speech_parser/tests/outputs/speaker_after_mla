Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, given that there are no details given in that answer, weâ€™d like those updates that the minister is referring to. Given the extra risk that seniors face from the coronavirus and given that the chief medical officer recommended that seniors take extra precautions due to this risk and given that many seniors are on fixed incomes, which could impede their ability to get supplies in the event they need to self-isolate, can the minister please outline in detail how she is planning to address the needs of seniors and, specifically, low-income seniors during this pandemic?

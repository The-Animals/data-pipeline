The Sergeant-at-Arms: Order! Order! Mr. Speaker.

[Preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Speaker, accompanied by
the officers of the Assembly, entered the Chamber and took the
chair]

head: Prayers

The Speaker: Let us pray. Almighty God, author of wisdom,
knowledge, and understanding, we ask your blessing on all here
present. We ask your guidance in order that the truth and justice
may prevail in all our judgments for the benefit of all Albertans.
Amen.Ladies and gentlemen, I would now invite you to join Cara
McLeod, accompanied by the Royal Canadian Artillery Band,
leading us in the singing of our national anthem. Please join us in
the language of your choice.

Hon. Members and Guests:O Canada, our home and native land!
True patriot love in all of us command.
Car ton bras sait porter l'épée,
Il sait porter la croix!
Ton histoire est une épopée
Des plus brillants exploits.
God keep our land glorious and free!
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

The Speaker: Thank you. Please be seated.

head: Entrance of the Lieutenant Governor

[The Premier, the Clerk, and the Sergeant-at-Arms left the Chamber
to attend the Lieutenant Governor]

[The Mace was draped]

The Speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. It's so nice to see
all of you. Holy cannoli. Hon. members, the RCA Band will now
play a brief musical interlude. The piece to be performed is entitled
Canzon Septimi Toni No. 2. It is the sprightliest of Giovanni
Gabrieli's larger works.
The RCA Band is Canada's oldest regular army band. It was
formed in Quebec City in 1879. It was subsequently stationed in
Montreal and Halifax and was reconstituted in Edmonton in 1997.
It has been in service in both world wars and in Korea, and it has
travelled across Canada and beyond our borders.
Please enjoy the performance by the Royal Canadian Artillery
Band brass choir.

[The Sergeant-at-Arms knocked on the main doors of the Chamber
three times. The Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms opened the doors, and
the Sergeant-at-Arms entered]

The Sergeant-at-Arms: Ladies and gentlemen, all rise, please.
Mr. Speaker, Her Honour the Honourable the Lieutenant
Governor awaits.

The Speaker: Sergeant-at-Arms, admit Her Honour the Honourable
the Lieutenant Governor.

[A fanfare of trumpets sounded] [Preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Her 
Honour the Lieutenant
Governor of Alberta, Lois Mitchell, CM, AOE, LLD, and Honorary
Colonel Douglas Mitchell, their party, the Premier, and the Clerk
entered the Chamber. Her Honour took her place upon the throne]

The Speaker: May it please Your Honour, the Legislative
Assembly has elected me their Speaker, though I am but little able
to fulfill the important duties thus assigned to me. If in the
performance of those duties I should at any time fall into error, I
pray that the fault may be imputed to me and not to the Assembly,
whose servant I am and who through me, the better to enable them
to discharge their duty to their Queen and province, humbly claim
all their undoubted rights and privileges, especially that they may
have freedom of speech in their debates, access to Your Honour's
person at all seasonable times, and that their proceedings may
receive from Your Honour the most favourable construction.

Mr. Schweitzer (Provincial Secretary): Mr. Speaker, I am
commanded by Her Honour the Honourable the Lieutenant Governor
to declare to you that she freely confides in the duty and attachment
of this Assembly to Her Majesty's person and government, and not
doubting that their proceedings will be conducted with wisdom,
temper, and prudence, she grants and upon all occasions will
recognize and allow their constitutional privileges.
I am commanded also to assure you that the Assembly shall have
ready access to Her Honour upon all seasonable occasions and that
their proceedings as well as your words and actions will constantly
receive from her the most favourable construction.

Her Honour: Please, all, be seated.

head: Speech from the Throne

Her Honour: Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the Legislative
Assembly, fellow Albertans:
I speak to you as the province of Alberta's vice-regal representative
of Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada.
This province honours its enduring ties to the Royal Family and
our democratic tradition of constitutional monarchy. One hundred
and fifty years ago this year the Hudson's Bay Company sold
Rupert's Land, including much of the territory that became the
province of Alberta, to the Dominion of Canada, bringing all of
these lands under the Canadian Crown. The same Crown enjoined
us in treaties with First Nations to respect the rights, privileges, and
traditions of indigenous communities, a duty which we are bound
to honour. Last year we renewed our ties to the Crown when we
were honoured by the visit of Anne, the Princess Royal. I had the
privilege of joining with her to announce Edmonton's Commonwealth
walkway.As Her Majesty's representative it is my honour and duty to open
the First Session of the 30th Legislature with the presentation of the
legislative program of Her Majesty's government.
Spring is the season of renewal. For all the people blessed to call
Alberta home, from the First Peoples who have built vital
communities on these lands for millennia to recent newcomers from
across Canada and around the world, spring arrives with an
explosion of nature's irrepressible energy. Every spring we
experience the breathtaking vitality of nature's rush to renewal and
are invigorated by it. So it is with our democracy. Once again, this
spring Albertans participated in the great democratic ritual of a free
election bequeathed to us by the Westminster parliamentary
tradition, and they voted decisively for democratic and economic
renewal through a change in government.


6 Alberta Hansard May 22, 2019

Recognizing that our province is beset by severe external
political and economic constraints and consequently saddled with
serious internal fiscal challenges requiring urgent action, my
government will bring in a legislative program focused on three
main priorities. First, a relentless focus on policies designed to
create jobs, growth, and economic diversification: Alberta must
show the world that we are open for business to restore investor
confidence while carefully restoring balance to our province's
finances. Second, standing up for our province's right to control and
develop our natural resources and compete freely and fairly in the
national and international economies: this requires securing
pipeline access for Alberta oil and gas to world markets. And third,
making life better for all Albertans by ensuring the quality and
effectiveness of our public services, especially in health care and
education, and by supporting the most vulnerable in our society.
, as promised, will be the Carbon Tax Repeal Act. In
providing $1.4 billion in tax relief, it will make everything more
affordable for Albertans. If needed, my ministers will take legal
action to protect Albertans from a federal carbon tax and to support
other provinces doing the same.
Bill 2 will be the Open for Business Act. It will strengthen the
rights of Alberta workers within unions, promote job creation for
young Albertans, and retain recent advancements in compassionate
leave. This will be followed in the autumn by further labour reforms
to protect workers and help employers create more jobs.
This spring my government will also introduce Bill 3, the Job
Creation Tax Cut Act. It will lower the tax burden on employers by
one-third, from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. This will give Alberta
businesses the lowest tax rate in Canada and among the lowest rates
in North America, renewing Alberta as a magnet for job-creating
investment. Economists estimate that this reduction will generate
55,000 new full-time jobs and increase the size of our economy by
$12.7 billion.
My government will bring forward Bill 4, the Red Tape
Reduction Act. This will provide the means to lower the regulatory
burden on Alberta's economy by one-third, reducing costs,
speeding up approvals, and freeing job creators to get more
Albertans back to work.
Estimates for the interim supply of public services will be
presented in an Appropriation Act, to be followed by a full budget
this fall. That budget will be informed by the report of the fiscal
review panel chaired by former Saskatchewan Finance minister
Janice MacKinnon, which will make recommendations on how to
restore balance to our province's finances so that we stop
encumbering future generations with debt. My government will
also engage in widespread public consultations on how best to end
deficit spending while protecting front-line public services.
My government will also present a Tax Statutes Amendment Act.
My government will propose amendments to the Municipal
Government Act. These will enable municipalities to use property
tax incentives to attract investment and create jobs.
My government will table a Royalties Guarantee Act. Part of a
plan to restore the competitiveness of the Alberta energy sector and
win back the confidence of investors, this legislation will provide
certainty that the royalty structure in place when a well is drilled
remains in place for the life of the well.
My government will introduce the Fair Access to Regulated
Professions and Trades Act. This legislation will renew and
reinforce Alberta's historic role as a place of economic opportunity
by making it easier and fairer for newcomers to be credentialed in
their professions, work at their skill level, and contribute to our
shared prosperity.
Her Majesty's government, on the very day it was sworn in,
proclaimed the Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act. It will be 
used as necessary to ensure the value of Alberta's energy
products is maximized.
Also, in the spring session my government will present
amendments to the Education Act. These will include implementing
the will of the Legislature as expressed in legislation passed in 2012
so that these well-considered reforms are in place for the start of the
new school year in September of this year. They will also include a
commitment to curriculum reform based on proven pedagogy that
teaches essential knowledge needed to achieve foundational
competences and to prepare young Albertans to succeed in the
future.My ministers will also undertake important nonlegislative actions
this spring. These include standing up for Alberta's interests within
the Canadian federation by seeking the Legislature's support for a
motion calling for the complete rejection of federal Bill C-48,
which seeks to block access for Alberta's bitumen resources to
British Columbia's northwest coast. A motion will also be proposed
rejecting in its current form federal Bill C-69, the proposed Impact
Assessment Act, which threatens Alberta's exclusive jurisdiction
over nonrenewable natural resources and is damaging investor
confidence. In bringing forward these and other initiatives, we will
seek unity amongst Alberta's political parties, wherever possible,
to speak with one voice.
In a world where the demand for energy will continue to rise,
Alberta can, should, and will be one of the largest suppliers. That is
why my government will create an agency mandated to proactively
tell the truth about how we produce energy with the highest
environmental, labour, and human rights standards on earth. My
government will also challenge those who have for too long
misrepresented these facts. In part this will be done by launching a
public inquiry into the foreign sources of funds responsible for the
campaign to land-lock Alberta's energy.
This year Her Majesty's government will also create the
indigenous opportunities corporation. Alberta's First Peoples have
played a crucial role in the development of this province,
symbolized by Siksika Chief Crowfoot, who as leader of the
Blackfoot peoples 150 years ago led his people into peaceful cooperation
with the Crown, including the signing of Treaty 7. But
while Alberta's natural resource wealth has been greatly developed
since then, indigenous peoples have not fully participated in that
prosperity. The indigenous opportunities corporation will support
First Nations' and other indigenous groups' financial participation
in natural resource development and infrastructure projects here
and in other parts of Canada. We have a moral obligation to
empower First Nations to be full partners in the development of the
resources that lie below the lands which their ancestors first
inhabited and to become partners in prosperity.
In the fall session my government will bring forward several
other important bills. These include the Farm Freedom and Safety
Act, which will reduce the tax and regulatory burden on farmers,
strengthen their property rights and competitiveness, and restore
balance, fairness, and common sense to regulation of Alberta's
agricultural sector.
My government will further improve Alberta's education system
by presenting the Choice in Education Act. It will renew the Alberta
advantage in education by restoring and expanding the choices
available to parents and children.
My government will take action to address climate change by
introducing legislation to replace the carbon competitiveness
incentive regulation with a technology innovation and emissions
reduction fund. This will be a balanced, environmentally
responsible, and economically efficient approach to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in Alberta through regulation at the


May 22, 2019 Alberta Hansard 7

primary source, large industrial emitters. Further, it will ensure
investment in new emissions-reducing technologies which can be
exported around the world.
To help protect vulnerable Albertans, my government will
introduce the Saving the Girl Next Door Act and table legislation
to give effect to Clare's law. The former will introduce protections
for victims of human trafficking, and the latter will expand
protections for victims of domestic violence. My government will
implement a strategy to combat the wave of crime that has
victimized too many Albertans, in part by hiring more Crown
prosecutors and providing additional resources to police to respond
to such terrible crimes as the exploitation of children.
And in order to improve decorum in this Assembly and civility
in our politics, my government will propose amendments to the
standing orders.
Members of the Legislative Assembly, this summarizes my
government's legislative program for the spring and fall sessions.
Further legislation anticipated for 2020 will address matters related
to democratic reform, economic growth and environmental
protection, public infrastructure, charitable giving, municipal
governance, the economic rights of artists, conservation and
outdoor recreation, and family law.
Renewal is the animating theme of my government's immediate
legislative priorities. It is the appropriate and necessary response to
the fiscal and economic setbacks Albertans have experienced in
recent years, and it is only fitting to look to our history, the
magnificent endowment of our natural resources and environment,
and above all the values and character of our people to inspire and
achieve this renewal.
The scale and pace of social and economic progress in Alberta
over the last 114 years exceeds that of virtually any other polity on
earth. We should always be grateful for those who have gone before
us, who have been stewards of a great tradition of ordered liberty.
Albertans have consistently applied the principles of free enterprise,
free markets, equality of opportunity, and prudent stewardship to
optimize our God-given gifts. No economic hardship has ever
ruined us. No political enmity has ever defeated us. No natural
disaster has ever stopped us. Our success, our resiliency, and our
yet-untapped potential is a powerful magnet that continues to attract
ambitious and talented newcomers from across Canada and the
world.The political forces standing in the way of this inevitable destiny
today are external and temporary. Her Majesty's government has a
strong mandate to stand up for Alberta against those forces,
powered by the unstoppable will, energy, and talent of Albertans.
Few places on earth provide such freedom of opportunity to achieve
so much upward social and economic mobility. This in turn fuels
our economic growth and generates wealth that spills far beyond
our borders and secures the prosperity and welfare of
Confederation. It is our duty and our destiny to renew Alberta's role
as an economic and political leader within Canada.
Members of the Legislative Assembly, if you would indulge my
passion for Alberta history, I will leave you with the closing words
of our province's very first Speech from the Throne, on March 15,
1906, delivered by His Honour Lieutenant Governor George
Hedley Vicars Bulyea:
To the several matters herein referred to and to all others that may
be brought before you, I invite your careful attention, with the
fullest confidence that the result of your deliberations will be
beneficial to the Province and to the Dominion as a whole.
May the blessings of Almighty God rest upon your counsels as
you work to renew an Alberta that is, in the words of our province's
official motto, strong and free. The Sergeant-at-Arms: Order! All rise, 
please.

The Speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, I would now invite you to
join Cara McLeod, accompanied by the Royal Canadian Artillery
Band, leading us in the singing of God Save the Queen. Please
remain standing at the conclusion.

Hon. Members and Guests:God save our gracious Queen,
Long live our noble Queen,
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the Queen!

The Sergeant-at-Arms: Order!

[Preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Their Honours, their party, and
the Premier left the Chamber as a fanfare of trumpets sounded]

The Speaker: Please be seated.

[The Mace was uncovered]

The Speaker: Well, ladies and gentlemen, former Premiers,
Members, family, friends, MPs, thank you all for joining us today
so, so very much on this very exciting occasion for all of us here
today and, in fact, all of us in this province. On April 16, 2019, over
1.894 million votes were cast in 87 constituencies throughout the
province of Alberta. As a result, 46 new members have joined a
very select group of individuals to serve in this storied Chamber.
Since 1905 a grand total of only 954 members have been elected to
serve in this venerable Chamber here at the Legislative Assembly
of Alberta.
It's important that we let Albertans know just a little bit more
about the 61 men and the 26 women who are serving here as MLAs.
In addition to the 46 new members, 35 members are serving their
second term in office, four members are serving their third term,
and two members are serving their fourth term in office. I think they
call that long suffering. Based on the information available to us,
the average age at the time of the general election was
approximately 46 years, which is unchanged from the 29th
Legislature. As of April 16, 2019, there were four members in their
20s; 18 members in their 30s, a very esteemed group of individuals;
24 members in their 40s; 25 members in their 50s; and eight
members  they happen to by my favourite  in their 60s.
Alberta is a dynamic province that welcomes people from other
cultures and countries. The majority of members were born here in
Alberta. However, there are members who were born in other
Canadian provinces as well as Brazil, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Fiji, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In addition to English, members
also communicate in the languages of French, Arabic, Cantonese,
Mandarin, Cree, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Punjabi,
Spanish, and, with apologies to the Filipinos, Tagalog.
Diversity is also reflected in members' previous work
experience. The occupational backgrounds of members vary from
musicians to economists, engineers to hairstylists, investment
bankers to hydrologists. To be more specific, there are 35
entrepreneurs or businesspeople; 11 lawyers  that's probably
enough  11 teachers and postsecondary instructors; eight ranchers
and farmers; and six social workers. One member was formerly a
Member of Parliament. Seven members previously held positions
in local government as councillors or school board trustees.


8 Alberta Hansard May 22, 2019

From an educational standpoint members collectively hold 66
bachelor's degrees, 25 master's, one doctorate, and 57 other
diplomas or certificates and professional designations.
Members of the 30th Legislature notably have some interesting
family ties. There are, for the first time in history, in the Legislative
Assembly of Alberta two brothers serving at the same time, one of
them slightly taller than the other. In fact, we're currently doing
some research to determine whether or not we are the tallest
Legislative Assembly of all time. There are two members whose
fathers have previously served in this Assembly. One member's
great-grandfather served in the 1930s. There are three members
whose great-uncles or great-uncles-in-law served in our Assembly.
Finally, we have three members who have cousins who have also
served as MLAs.
To conclude, the members of the 30th Legislature are a diverse
and capable group whose knowledge and experience will assist us
in carrying out our responsibilities as parliamentarians and elected
representatives in the service of this great province of Alberta.

An Act to Repeal the Carbon Tax

Mr. Kenney: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Congratulations on your
election. I request leave to introduce , An Act to Repeal the
Carbon Tax.
Mr. Speaker, our government is taking action to deliver on the
commitment that we made to Albertans to repeal this tax grab,
which is all economic pain and no environmental gain. This
measure, if adopted, will lift a burden of $1.4 billion off the Alberta
economy, will save families as much as $1,150 per year, will save small 
businesses on average $4,500 per year, and will, according to
economists, lead to the creation of at least 6,000 new full-time jobs.
Mr. Speaker, a recent study indicates that Albertans have been
paying the second-highest carbon tax in Canada, far more than our
fellow Canadians, and this has not secured for us so-called social
licence or market access for our world-class energy. We therefore
propose in this measure to provide important tax relief to Albertans.
Albertans have been waiting for this relief, which is why
consistently two-thirds of Albertans have expressed opposition to
the tax that will be repealed by . Promise made, promise kept.
This being a money bill, Her Honour the Honourable the
Lieutenant Governor, having been informed of the contents of the
bill, recommends the same to the Assembly.
With that, I move first reading of .

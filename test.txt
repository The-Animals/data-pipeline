<br />
The Sergeant-at-Arms: Order! Order! Mr. Speaker.<br />
<br />
[Preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Speaker, accompanied by<br />
the officers of the Assembly, entered the Chamber and took the<br />
chair]<br />
<br />
head: Prayers<br />
<br />
The Speaker: Let us pray. Almighty God, author of wisdom,<br />
knowledge, and understanding, we ask your blessing on all here<br />
present. We ask your guidance in order that the truth and justice<br />
may prevail in all our judgments for the benefit of all Albertans.<br />
Amen.Ladies and gentlemen, I would now invite you to join Cara<br />
McLeod, accompanied by the Royal Canadian Artillery Band,<br />
leading us in the singing of our national anthem. Please join us in<br />
the language of your choice.<br />
<br />
Hon. Members and Guests:O Canada, our home and native land!<br />
True patriot love in all of us command.<br />
Car ton bras sait porter l'épée,<br />
Il sait porter la croix!<br />
Ton histoire est une épopée<br />
Des plus brillants exploits.<br />
God keep our land glorious and free!<br />
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<br />
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<br />
<br />
The Speaker: Thank you. Please be seated.<br />
<br />
head: Entrance of the Lieutenant Governor<br />
<br />
[The Premier, the Clerk, and the Sergeant-at-Arms left the Chamber<br />
to attend the Lieutenant Governor]<br />
<br />
[The Mace was draped]<br />
<br />
The Speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. It's so nice to see<br />
all of you. Holy cannoli. Hon. members, the RCA Band will now<br />
play a brief musical interlude. The piece to be performed is entitled<br />
Canzon Septimi Toni No. 2. It is the sprightliest of Giovanni<br />
Gabrieli's larger works.<br />
The RCA Band is Canada's oldest regular army band. It was<br />
formed in Quebec City in 1879. It was subsequently stationed in<br />
Montreal and Halifax and was reconstituted in Edmonton in 1997.<br />
It has been in service in both world wars and in Korea, and it has<br />
travelled across Canada and beyond our borders.<br />
Please enjoy the performance by the Royal Canadian Artillery<br />
Band brass choir.<br />

Mr. Speaker, Her Honour the Honourable the Lieutenant<br />
Governor awaits.<br />
<br />

the Lieutenant Governor.<br />
<br />
[A fanfare of trumpets sounded] [Preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Her <br />
Honour the Lieutenant<br />
Governor of Alberta, Lois Mitchell, CM, AOE, LLD, and Honorary<br />
Colonel Douglas Mitchell, their party, the Premier, and the Clerk<br />
entered the Chamber. Her Honour took her place upon the throne]<br />
<br />
The Speaker: May it please Your Honour, the Legislative<br />
Assembly has elected me their Speaker, though I am but little able<br />
to fulfill the important duties thus assigned to me. If in the<br />
performance of those duties I should at any time fall into error, I<br />
pray that the fault may be imputed to me and not to the Assembly,<br />
whose servant I am and who through me, the better to enable them<br />
to discharge their duty to their Queen and province, humbly claim<br />
all their undoubted rights and privileges, especially that they may<br />
have freedom of speech in their debates, access to Your Honour's<br />
person at all seasonable times, and that their proceedings may<br />
receive from Your Honour the most favourable construction.<br />
<br />
Mr. Schweitzer (Provincial Secretary): Mr. Speaker, I am<br />
commanded by Her Honour the Honourable the Lieutenant Governor<br />
to declare to you that she freely confides in the duty and attachment<br />
of this Assembly to Her Majesty's person and government, and not<br />
doubting that their proceedings will be conducted with wisdom,<br />
temper, and prudence, she grants and upon all occasions will<br />
recognize and allow their constitutional privileges.<br />
I am commanded also to assure you that the Assembly shall have<br />
ready access to Her Honour upon all seasonable occasions and that<br />
their proceedings as well as your words and actions will constantly<br />
receive from her the most favourable construction.<br />
<br />
Her Honour: Please, all, be seated.<br />
<br />
head: Speech from the Throne<br />
<br />
Her Honour: Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the Legislative<br />
Assembly, fellow Albertans:<br />
I speak to you as the province of Alberta's vice-regal representative<br />
of Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada.<br />
This province honours its enduring ties to the Royal Family and<br />
our democratic tradition of constitutional monarchy. One hundred<br />
and fifty years ago this year the Hudson's Bay Company sold<br />
Rupert's Land, including much of the territory that became the<br />
province of Alberta, to the Dominion of Canada, bringing all of<br />
these lands under the Canadian Crown. The same Crown enjoined<br />
us in treaties with First Nations to respect the rights, privileges, and<br />
traditions of indigenous communities, a duty which we are bound<br />
to honour. Last year we renewed our ties to the Crown when we<br />
were honoured by the visit of Anne, the Princess Royal. I had the<br />
privilege of joining with her to announce Edmonton's Commonwealth<br />
walkway.As Her Majesty's representative it is my honour and duty to open<br />
the First Session of the 30th Legislature with the presentation of the<br />
legislative program of Her Majesty's government.<br />
Spring is the season of renewal. For all the people blessed to call<br />
Alberta home, from the First Peoples who have built vital<br />
communities on these lands for millennia to recent newcomers from<br />
across Canada and around the world, spring arrives with an<br />
explosion of nature's irrepressible energy. Every spring we<br />
experience the breathtaking vitality of nature's rush to renewal and<br />
are invigorated by it. So it is with our democracy. Once again, this<br />
spring Albertans participated in the great democratic ritual of a free<br />
election bequeathed to us by the Westminster parliamentary<br />
tradition, and they voted decisively for democratic and economic<br />
renewal through a change in government.<br />
<br />
<br />
6 Alberta Hansard May 22, 2019<br />
<br />
Recognizing that our province is beset by severe external<br />
political and economic constraints and consequently saddled with<br />
serious internal fiscal challenges requiring urgent action, my<br />
government will bring in a legislative program focused on three<br />
main priorities. First, a relentless focus on policies designed to<br />
create jobs, growth, and economic diversification: Alberta must<br />
show the world that we are open for business to restore investor<br />
confidence while carefully restoring balance to our province's<br />
finances. Second, standing up for our province's right to control and<br />
develop our natural resources and compete freely and fairly in the<br />
national and international economies: this requires securing<br />
pipeline access for Alberta oil and gas to world markets. And third,<br />
making life better for all Albertans by ensuring the quality and<br />
effectiveness of our public services, especially in health care and<br />
education, and by supporting the most vulnerable in our society.<br />
<a class="isys" name="hit1"></a><a class="isys" name="term0_1"></a><span color="#000000" style="background-color:#FFFF66"><b>Bill 1</b></span><a class="isys" href="#hit2"><img src="/Documents/images/nexthit.gif" alt="Next Hit" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>, as promised, will be the Carbon Tax Repeal Act. In<br />
providing $1.4 billion in tax relief, it will make everything more<br />
affordable for Albertans. If needed, my ministers will take legal<br />
action to protect Albertans from a federal carbon tax and to support<br />
other provinces doing the same.<br />
Bill 2 will be the Open for Business Act. It will strengthen the<br />
rights of Alberta workers within unions, promote job creation for<br />
young Albertans, and retain recent advancements in compassionate<br />
leave. This will be followed in the autumn by further labour reforms<br />
to protect workers and help employers create more jobs.<br />
This spring my government will also introduce Bill 3, the Job<br />
Creation Tax Cut Act. It will lower the tax burden on employers by<br />
one-third, from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. This will give Alberta<br />
businesses the lowest tax rate in Canada and among the lowest rates<br />
in North America, renewing Alberta as a magnet for job-creating<br />
investment. Economists estimate that this reduction will generate<br />
55,000 new full-time jobs and increase the size of our economy by<br />
$12.7 billion.<br />
My government will bring forward Bill 4, the Red Tape<br />
Reduction Act. This will provide the means to lower the regulatory<br />
burden on Alberta's economy by one-third, reducing costs,<br />
speeding up approvals, and freeing job creators to get more<br />
Albertans back to work.<br />
Estimates for the interim supply of public services will be<br />
presented in an Appropriation Act, to be followed by a full budget<br />
this fall. That budget will be informed by the report of the fiscal<br />
review panel chaired by former Saskatchewan Finance minister<br />
Janice MacKinnon, which will make recommendations on how to<br />
restore balance to our province's finances so that we stop<br />
encumbering future generations with debt. My government will<br />
also engage in widespread public consultations on how best to end<br />
deficit spending while protecting front-line public services.<br />
My government will also present a Tax Statutes Amendment Act.<br />
My government will propose amendments to the Municipal<br />
Government Act. These will enable municipalities to use property<br />
tax incentives to attract investment and create jobs.<br />
My government will table a Royalties Guarantee Act. Part of a<br />
plan to restore the competitiveness of the Alberta energy sector and<br />
win back the confidence of investors, this legislation will provide<br />
certainty that the royalty structure in place when a well is drilled<br />
remains in place for the life of the well.<br />
My government will introduce the Fair Access to Regulated<br />
Professions and Trades Act. This legislation will renew and<br />
reinforce Alberta's historic role as a place of economic opportunity<br />
by making it easier and fairer for newcomers to be credentialed in<br />
their professions, work at their skill level, and contribute to our<br />
shared prosperity.<br />
Her Majesty's government, on the very day it was sworn in,<br />
proclaimed the Preserving Canada's Economic Prosperity Act. It will be <br />
used as necessary to ensure the value of Alberta's energy<br />
products is maximized.<br />
Also, in the spring session my government will present<br />
amendments to the Education Act. These will include implementing<br />
the will of the Legislature as expressed in legislation passed in 2012<br />
so that these well-considered reforms are in place for the start of the<br />
new school year in September of this year. They will also include a<br />
commitment to curriculum reform based on proven pedagogy that<br />
teaches essential knowledge needed to achieve foundational<br />
competences and to prepare young Albertans to succeed in the<br />
future.My ministers will also undertake important nonlegislative actions<br />
this spring. These include standing up for Alberta's interests within<br />
the Canadian federation by seeking the Legislature's support for a<br />
motion calling for the complete rejection of federal Bill C-48,<br />
which seeks to block access for Alberta's bitumen resources to<br />
British Columbia's northwest coast. A motion will also be proposed<br />
rejecting in its current form federal Bill C-69, the proposed Impact<br />
Assessment Act, which threatens Alberta's exclusive jurisdiction<br />
over nonrenewable natural resources and is damaging investor<br />
confidence. In bringing forward these and other initiatives, we will<br />
seek unity amongst Alberta's political parties, wherever possible,<br />
to speak with one voice.<br />
In a world where the demand for energy will continue to rise,<br />
Alberta can, should, and will be one of the largest suppliers. That is<br />
why my government will create an agency mandated to proactively<br />
tell the truth about how we produce energy with the highest<br />
environmental, labour, and human rights standards on earth. My<br />
government will also challenge those who have for too long<br />
misrepresented these facts. In part this will be done by launching a<br />
public inquiry into the foreign sources of funds responsible for the<br />
campaign to land-lock Alberta's energy.<br />
This year Her Majesty's government will also create the<br />
indigenous opportunities corporation. Alberta's First Peoples have<br />
played a crucial role in the development of this province,<br />
symbolized by Siksika Chief Crowfoot, who as leader of the<br />
Blackfoot peoples 150 years ago led his people into peaceful cooperation<br />
with the Crown, including the signing of Treaty 7. But<br />
while Alberta's natural resource wealth has been greatly developed<br />
since then, indigenous peoples have not fully participated in that<br />
prosperity. The indigenous opportunities corporation will support<br />
First Nations' and other indigenous groups' financial participation<br />
in natural resource development and infrastructure projects here<br />
and in other parts of Canada. We have a moral obligation to<br />
empower First Nations to be full partners in the development of the<br />
resources that lie below the lands which their ancestors first<br />
inhabited and to become partners in prosperity.<br />
In the fall session my government will bring forward several<br />
other important bills. These include the Farm Freedom and Safety<br />
Act, which will reduce the tax and regulatory burden on farmers,<br />
strengthen their property rights and competitiveness, and restore<br />
balance, fairness, and common sense to regulation of Alberta's<br />
agricultural sector.<br />
My government will further improve Alberta's education system<br />
by presenting the Choice in Education Act. It will renew the Alberta<br />
advantage in education by restoring and expanding the choices<br />
available to parents and children.<br />
My government will take action to address climate change by<br />
introducing legislation to replace the carbon competitiveness<br />
incentive regulation with a technology innovation and emissions<br />
reduction fund. This will be a balanced, environmentally<br />
responsible, and economically efficient approach to reducing<br />
greenhouse gas emissions in Alberta through regulation at the<br />
<br />
<br />
May 22, 2019 Alberta Hansard 7<br />
<br />
primary source, large industrial emitters. Further, it will ensure<br />
investment in new emissions-reducing technologies which can be<br />
exported around the world.<br />
To help protect vulnerable Albertans, my government will<br />
introduce the Saving the Girl Next Door Act and table legislation<br />
to give effect to Clare's law. The former will introduce protections<br />
for victims of human trafficking, and the latter will expand<br />
protections for victims of domestic violence. My government will<br />
implement a strategy to combat the wave of crime that has<br />
victimized too many Albertans, in part by hiring more Crown<br />
prosecutors and providing additional resources to police to respond<br />
to such terrible crimes as the exploitation of children.<br />
And in order to improve decorum in this Assembly and civility<br />
in our politics, my government will propose amendments to the<br />
standing orders.<br />
Members of the Legislative Assembly, this summarizes my<br />
government's legislative program for the spring and fall sessions.<br />
Further legislation anticipated for 2020 will address matters related<br />
to democratic reform, economic growth and environmental<br />
protection, public infrastructure, charitable giving, municipal<br />
governance, the economic rights of artists, conservation and<br />
outdoor recreation, and family law.<br />
Renewal is the animating theme of my government's immediate<br />
legislative priorities. It is the appropriate and necessary response to<br />
the fiscal and economic setbacks Albertans have experienced in<br />
recent years, and it is only fitting to look to our history, the<br />
magnificent endowment of our natural resources and environment,<br />
and above all the values and character of our people to inspire and<br />
achieve this renewal.<br />
The scale and pace of social and economic progress in Alberta<br />
over the last 114 years exceeds that of virtually any other polity on<br />
earth. We should always be grateful for those who have gone before<br />
us, who have been stewards of a great tradition of ordered liberty.<br />
Albertans have consistently applied the principles of free enterprise,<br />
free markets, equality of opportunity, and prudent stewardship to<br />
optimize our God-given gifts. No economic hardship has ever<br />
ruined us. No political enmity has ever defeated us. No natural<br />
disaster has ever stopped us. Our success, our resiliency, and our<br />
yet-untapped potential is a powerful magnet that continues to attract<br />
ambitious and talented newcomers from across Canada and the<br />
world.The political forces standing in the way of this inevitable destiny<br />
today are external and temporary. Her Majesty's government has a<br />
strong mandate to stand up for Alberta against those forces,<br />
powered by the unstoppable will, energy, and talent of Albertans.<br />
Few places on earth provide such freedom of opportunity to achieve<br />
so much upward social and economic mobility. This in turn fuels<br />
our economic growth and generates wealth that spills far beyond<br />
our borders and secures the prosperity and welfare of<br />
Confederation. It is our duty and our destiny to renew Alberta's role<br />
as an economic and political leader within Canada.<br />
Members of the Legislative Assembly, if you would indulge my<br />
passion for Alberta history, I will leave you with the closing words<br />
of our province's very first Speech from the Throne, on March 15,<br />
1906, delivered by His Honour Lieutenant Governor George<br />
Hedley Vicars Bulyea:<br />
To the several matters herein referred to and to all others that may<br />
be brought before you, I invite your careful attention, with the<br />
fullest confidence that the result of your deliberations will be<br />
beneficial to the Province and to the Dominion as a whole.<br />
May the blessings of Almighty God rest upon your counsels as<br />
you work to renew an Alberta that is, in the words of our province's<br />
official motto, strong and free. The Sergeant-at-Arms: Order! All rise, <br />
please.<br />
<br />
The Speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, I would now invite you to<br />
join Cara McLeod, accompanied by the Royal Canadian Artillery<br />
Band, leading us in the singing of God Save the Queen. Please<br />
remain standing at the conclusion.<br />
<br />
Hon. Members and Guests:God save our gracious Queen,<br />
Long live our noble Queen,<br />
God save the Queen!<br />
Send her victorious,<br />
Happy and glorious,<br />
Long to reign over us,<br />
God save the Queen!<br />
<br />
The Sergeant-at-Arms: Order!<br />
<br />
[Preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Their Honours, their party, and<br />
the Premier left the Chamber as a fanfare of trumpets sounded]<br />
<br />
The Speaker: Please be seated.<br />
<br />
[The Mace was uncovered]<br />
<br />
The Speaker: Well, ladies and gentlemen, former Premiers,<br />
Members, family, friends, MPs, thank you all for joining us today<br />
so, so very much on this very exciting occasion for all of us here<br />
today and, in fact, all of us in this province. On April 16, 2019, over<br />
1.894 million votes were cast in 87 constituencies throughout the<br />
province of Alberta. As a result, 46 new members have joined a<br />
very select group of individuals to serve in this storied Chamber.<br />
Since 1905 a grand total of only 954 members have been elected to<br />
serve in this venerable Chamber here at the Legislative Assembly<br />
of Alberta.<br />
It's important that we let Albertans know just a little bit more<br />
about the 61 men and the 26 women who are serving here as MLAs.<br />
In addition to the 46 new members, 35 members are serving their<br />
second term in office, four members are serving their third term,<br />
and two members are serving their fourth term in office. I think they<br />
call that long suffering. Based on the information available to us,<br />
the average age at the time of the general election was<br />
approximately 46 years, which is unchanged from the 29th<br />
Legislature. As of April 16, 2019, there were four members in their<br />
20s; 18 members in their 30s, a very esteemed group of individuals;<br />
24 members in their 40s; 25 members in their 50s; and eight<br />
members – they happen to by my favourite – in their 60s.<br />
Alberta is a dynamic province that welcomes people from other<br />
cultures and countries. The majority of members were born here in<br />
Alberta. However, there are members who were born in other<br />
Canadian provinces as well as Brazil, Chile, China, Hong Kong,<br />
Fiji, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In addition to English, members<br />
also communicate in the languages of French, Arabic, Cantonese,<br />
Mandarin, Cree, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Punjabi,<br />
Spanish, and, with apologies to the Filipinos, Tagalog.<br />
Diversity is also reflected in members' previous work<br />
experience. The occupational backgrounds of members vary from<br />
musicians to economists, engineers to hairstylists, investment<br />
bankers to hydrologists. To be more specific, there are 35<br />
entrepreneurs or businesspeople; 11 lawyers – that's probably<br />
enough – 11 teachers and postsecondary instructors; eight ranchers<br />
and farmers; and six social workers. One member was formerly a<br />
Member of Parliament. Seven members previously held positions<br />
in local government as councillors or school board trustees.<br />
<br />
<br />
8 Alberta Hansard May 22, 2019<br />
<br />
From an educational standpoint members collectively hold 66<br />
bachelor's degrees, 25 master's, one doctorate, and 57 other<br />
diplomas or certificates and professional designations.<br />
Members of the 30th Legislature notably have some interesting<br />
family ties. There are, for the first time in history, in the Legislative<br />
Assembly of Alberta two brothers serving at the same time, one of<br />
them slightly taller than the other. In fact, we're currently doing<br />
some research to determine whether or not we are the tallest<br />
Legislative Assembly of all time. There are two members whose<br />
fathers have previously served in this Assembly. One member's<br />
great-grandfather served in the 1930s. There are three members<br />
whose great-uncles or great-uncles-in-law served in our Assembly.<br />
Finally, we have three members who have cousins who have also<br />
served as MLAs.<br />
To conclude, the members of the 30th Legislature are a diverse<br />
and capable group whose knowledge and experience will assist us<br />
in carrying out our responsibilities as parliamentarians and elected<br />
representatives in the service of this great province of Alberta.<br />

<br />
Mr. Kenney: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Congratulations on your<br />
election. I request leave to introduce <a class="isys" name="hit3"></a><a class="isys" href="#hit2"><img src="/Documents/images/prevhit.gif" alt="Previous Hit" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a><a class="isys" name="term0_3"></a><span color="#000000" style="background-color:#FFFF66"><b>Bill 1</b></span><a class="isys" href="#hit4"><img src="/Documents/images/nexthit.gif" alt="Next Hit" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>, An Act to Repeal the<br />
Carbon Tax.<br />
Mr. Speaker, our government is taking action to deliver on the<br />
commitment that we made to Albertans to repeal this tax grab,<br />
which is all economic pain and no environmental gain. This<br />
measure, if adopted, will lift a burden of $1.4 billion off the Alberta<br />
economy, will save families as much as $1,150 per year, will save small <br />
businesses on average $4,500 per year, and will, according to<br />
economists, lead to the creation of at least 6,000 new full-time jobs.<br />
Mr. Speaker, a recent study indicates that Albertans have been<br />
paying the second-highest carbon tax in Canada, far more than our<br />
fellow Canadians, and this has not secured for us so-called social<br />
licence or market access for our world-class energy. We therefore<br />
propose in this measure to provide important tax relief to Albertans.<br />
Albertans have been waiting for this relief, which is why<br />
consistently two-thirds of Albertans have expressed opposition to<br />
the tax that will be repealed by <a class="isys" name="hit4"></a><a class="isys" href="#hit3"><img src="/Documents/images/prevhit.gif" alt="Previous Hit" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a><a class="isys" name="term0_4"></a><span color="#000000" style="background-color:#FFFF66"><b>Bill 1</b></span><a class="isys" href="#hit5"><img src="/Documents/images/nexthit.gif" alt="Next Hit" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.
